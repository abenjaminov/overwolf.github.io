Launcher IDs can be used to auto-launch your app when a game launcher starts (this is currently available only for [League of Legends](events/league-of-legends)).

To do so, add the Launcher Id to the [launch_events](../../manifest#launch_events) option in your app’s manifest.json file.

Example:

```json
"launch_events": [
    {
        "event": "GameLaunch",
        "event_data": {
            "game_ids": [10902]
        },
        "start_minimized": true
    }
]
```

In this example, the app will be auto-launched when the League of Legends client starts. In this code example the app’s main window will be minimized, you can change this by using  `start_minimized` false).
