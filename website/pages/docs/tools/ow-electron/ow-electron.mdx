Overwolf Electron is a solution built on top of [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), aimed at allowing Electron apps access to certain Overwolf APIs.

- [@overwolf/ow-electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/ow-electron) is a package based on the
[electron package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron) package, adding several new features to it.
- [@overwolf/ow-electron-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/ow-electron-builder) is a package based on the 
[electron-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-builder) package, which supports building ow-electron apps.
- [@overwolf/electron-is-overwolf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/electron-is-overwolf) - similar to the
[electron-is-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-is-dev) package, allows your app to check whether it's running as Overwolf Electron vs non-overwolf Electron.

There is no problem for all of these packages to reside side-by-side with the original
electron/electron-builder packages in your project. In order to be able to run your app with Overwolf Electron,
you only need to add new start and build scripts in your package.json file:

import StartAndBuild from './package/_build-and-start.mdx'

<StartAndBuild/>

## Unique App ID

import AppAndAuthorName from './package/_app-and-author-name.mdx'

<AppAndAuthorName/>

Unique app ids are used for ads optimizations, as well as for optional [anonymous analytics](#anonymous-analytics) reports that you may review on our developer's console.

:::note Referring To App ID In Your app
Once the `app.whenReady` promise resolves, your app's uid will be available, using the OVERWOLF_APP_UID environment variable (process.env.OVERWOLF_APP_UID).
However, note that if you try to access it before the app is ready, the variable simply won't exist.
:::

## The owadview tag

import OverwolfAdView from './overwolf-ad-view/_overwolf-ad-view.mdx'

<OverwolfAdView/>

## Anonymous Analytics

In order to generate usage reports for your Overwolf Electron app, we collect a small number of anonymous analytics (such as when the app is launched,
and when a certain app's window is shown).

You can disable these analytics with the following piece of code:

```js
import { app } from 'electron';

app.overwolf.disableAnonymousAnalytics();

...

app.whenReady().then(...)
```

:::note Disabling Analytics
App analytics are disabled on a per-session basis. If you wish to completely disable them, you must do so before every app start, when initailizing your app.

## Consent Management Platform (CMP)

CMP makes it easier for you to meet the legal requirements governing data collection in certain parts of the world,
by helping you handle the process of receiving consent to collect user cookies.

Before using your app, users should be informed about the existence of the CMP, as well as where to find it.

We recommend introducing it during the installation phase or as a first-time usage message.

Overwolf Electron comes with a built in CMP implementation.

:::note Windows Installer CMP
Our Windows installer automatically handles the introduction of the CMP to users. If you wish to use it, [ask us for more details](/support/contact-us).
:::

In order to know if the user is required to be informed about the CMP - you can use the `app.overwolf.isCMPRequired` method:

```js
import { app } from 'electron';

await app.overwolf.isCMPRequired();
```

To open the built-in CMP window - use the `app.overwolf.openCMPWindow` method:

```js
app.overwolf.openCMPWindow();
```
