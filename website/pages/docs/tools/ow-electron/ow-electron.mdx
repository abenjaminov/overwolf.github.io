ow-electron is a solution built on top of [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), aimed at allowing electron apps access to Overwolf APIs.

- [@overwolf/ow-electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/ow-electron) is a package based on the
[electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron) package, adding several new features to it.
- [@overwolf/ow-electron-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/ow-electron-builder) is a package based on the 
[electron-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-builder) package, which supports building ow-electron apps.
- [@overwolf/electron-is-overwolf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/electron-is-overwolf) - similar to the
[electron-is-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-is-dev) package, allows your app to check whether it's currently running as ow-electron, or as a non-overwolf electron app.

There is no problem with running both ow-electron and electron side-by-side on the same project. In order to run your app with ow-electron,
you only need to add new start and build scripts in your package.json file:

import StartAndBuild from '../../api/electron/package/_build-and-start.mdx'

<StartAndBuild/>

## Unique App ID

import AppAndAuthorName from '../../api/electron/package/_app-and-author-name.mdx'

<AppAndAuthorName/>

Unique app ids are used for ads optimizations, as well as for optional [anonymous analytics](#anonymous-analytics) reports that you may review on our developer's console.

:::note Referring To App ID In Your app
Once the `app.whenReady` promise resolves, your app's uid will be available, using the `OVERWOLF_APP_UID` environment variable (`process.env.OVERWOLF_APP_UID`).
However, note that if you try to access it before the app is ready, the variable simply won't exist.

## The owadview tag

import OverwolfAdView from './overwolf-ad-view/_tag.mdx'

<OverwolfAdView/>

## Anonymous Analytics

In order to generate usage reports for your ow-electron app, we collect a small number of anonymous analytics (such as when the app is launched,
and when a certain app's window is shown).

You can disable these analytics with the following piece of code:

```js
import { app } from 'electron';

app.overwolf.disableAnonymousAnalytics();

...

app.whenReady().then(...)
```

:::note Disabling Analytics
App analytics are disabled on a per-session basis. If you wish to completely disable them, you must do so before every app start, when initailizing your app.

## Consent Management Platform (CMP)
