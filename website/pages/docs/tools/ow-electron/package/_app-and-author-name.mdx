Every Overwolf application, be it Overwolf Electron or Overwolf Platform, has a unique app id. This unique id is automatically generated, and is based on the app's name,
and the app's author's name.

In Overwolf Electron, these fields correspond to the following fields in the package.json file:
- App name - The `productName` or `name` properties
- App author - The `name` field under the `author` field.

```js title="Partial package.json with the relevant fields"
{

  "author": {
    "name": "Overwolf"
  },

  "build": {

    "productName": "ow-electron-sample-app",

  }

}
