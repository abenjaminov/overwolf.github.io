A CMP makes it easier for you to meet the stricter legal requirements governing data collection in certain parts of the world,
by helping you handle the process of receiving consent to collect user cookies. This also allows you to show ads to users living in those areas.

ow-electron comes with a built in CMP, which your app can utilize out of the box.
This allows you to:
- Check if a user needs to be informed of the CMP
- Show them the CMP itself if necessary, applying any settings they use to the entire ow-electron package

The relevant users should then be informed about the existence of the CMP, as well as where they can find it in the app.

### Introducing the CMP

There are two ways to introduce the relevant users to the CMP:
- During the app's installation - **Recommended**
- On the app's first start, as part of the First Time User Experience (FTUE)
    - If you are migrating your app to ow-electron, this will also apply to the first time that existing users start the app after the update
