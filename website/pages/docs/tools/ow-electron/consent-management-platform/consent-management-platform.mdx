## Installer CMP Mockup

Below is an installer mockup, with the CMP built into it:

## Introducing the CMP to users

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="installer-cmp" label="CMP During Installation" default>

:::note Overwolf Windows Installer
Our Windows installer automatically handles the introduction of the CMP to users during installation, among other things. If you wish to use it,
[ask us for more details](/support/contact-us).
:::

In order to introduce the CMP during installation, you must show users a notice informing them about the CMP before starting the installation.
We'll use CurseForge's installer notice as an example:

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ftue-cmp" label="CMP During FTUE">

:::note FTUE And Migration To ow-electron
For the purposes discussed here, a user updating from a non ow-electron version of the app, to an ow-electron version of the app,
is treated as a First Time User, and should be shown the CMP as if they were a new user.
:::

In order to introduce the CMP inside the app itself, you must show First Time Users a notice informing them about the CMP.
We'll use CurseForge's installer notice as a reference:

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

![Initial Notice (CurseForge)](/assets/tools/ow-electron/consent-management-platform/notice.jpg)

<details>
<summary>CMP Notice Template</summary>

{Your-App-Name-Here} supports the display of in-app ads.
This helps app developers make a living,
and provide you with free high-quality apps.
In order to deliver ads that are relevant for you,
{Your-App-Name-Here} and trusted ad vendors store and/or access information on your computer,
and process personal data such as IP address and cookies.
Click the “Manage” button to control your consents,
or to object to the processing of your data when done on the basis of legitmate interest.
You can change your prefrences at any time via Overwolf settings. 

Purposes we use: Store and/or access information on a device,
personalised ads and content, ad and content measurement,
audience insights and product development.

</details>

Users can then click `Manage`, in order to open the CMP window directly, and configure it however they wish.

Once done, they **must** click to continue:
- `Accept & Install` - If done during installation. Proceeds to install the app
- `Accept & Continue` - If done during FTUE. Proceeds to continue to the app


## Allowing users to access the CMP

Once the user has been introduced to the CMP, they must be able to find it if they ever wish to alter its settings.

This is usually achieved by having a **clearly visible** section in the app's settings, called `Privacy`, that shows the following when clicked:

![Privacy Settings](/assets/tools/ow-electron/consent-management-platform/privacy-settings.jpg)

Clicking on `Manage` then opens the CMP window, in the same way that it was opened at the start.
