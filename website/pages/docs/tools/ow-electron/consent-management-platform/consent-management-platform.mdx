## Introducing the CMP to users

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="installer-cmp" label="CMP During Installation" default>

:::note Overwolf Windows Installer
Our [Windows installer](./installer) automatically handles the introduction of the CMP to users during installation, among other things. If you wish to use it,
[ask us for more details](/support/contact-us).
:::

In order to introduce the CMP during installation, you must show users a notice informing them about the CMP before starting the installation.
We'll use CurseForge's installer notice as an example:

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ftue-cmp" label="CMP During FTUE">

:::note FTUE And Migration To ow-electron
For the purposes discussed here, a user updating from a non ow-electron version of the app, to an ow-electron version of the app,
is treated as a First Time User, and should be shown the CMP as if they were a new user.
:::

In order to introduce the CMP inside the app itself, you must show First Time Users a notice informing them about the CMP.
We'll use CurseForge's installer notice as a reference:

</TabItem>
