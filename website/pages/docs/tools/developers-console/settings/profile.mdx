![The Store Listing Tab](/assets/tools/developers-console/settings/profile/index.jpg)
This section of the console allows you to manage your Developer's Console profile.

## API Keys

Certain services (like the [Overwolf CLI](/tools/ow-cli)), may require a developer's console API key in order to work.
Here, you can revoke/generate an API key linked to your account, for such services.

:::warning
This key will allow the service to perform actions on your behalf through the console. As such, always make sure that
you trust any service you give your API key to, and revoke it as soon as you suspect it might have been leaked/compromised!
