The [**Overwolf Developer's Console**](https://console.overwolf.com) (also sometimes known as the **Dev Console**), serves as the go to place for managing your applications.

:::note App visibility
An application does not have to be "public" in order to appear in the console. It can exist in "hidden" mode, where it can only be
downloaded by users with a direct download link to the app. For more details, feel free to contact your DevRel manager
(or just [contact us](/support/contact-us) if you do not yet have a DevRel manager)
:::

Using the developer's console, you can interact with many things, including:
- An overview of [all apps you are part of](developers-console/all-applications). For each app, you can then also interact with:
    - App [Dashboards](developers-console/all-applications/dashboard), showing your app's performance statistics.
    - [App releases](developers-console/all-applications/release-management), based on the Release Channels model.
        - Control your app's [Production](developers-console/all-applications/release-management/production) version.
        - Create and manage your app's [Testing](developers-console/all-applications/release-management/testing) versions.
    - The [Store listing](developers-console/all-applications/store-listing) for your app.
    - User [Crash reports](developers-console/all-applications/crash-reports), which you can use to debug issues as they occur in the wild.
    - Manage [App's Subscriptions](developers-console/all-applications/subscriptions).
        - View app subscription [Statistics](developers-console/all-applications/subscriptions/statistics).
        - Manage your app's [Subscription plans](developers-console/all-applications/subscriptions/subscription-plans).
        - View and manage your app's active [Subscribers](developers-console/all-applications/subscriptions/subscribers).
    - View all of your app's [Reviews](developers-console/all-applications/user-feedback/reviews).
- You can also manage your developer's console account under [settings](developers-console/settings).
    - View and edit details about your [profile](developers-console/settings/profile).

:::tip Integrations
The developer's console also:
- Works with the [ow-cli](/tools/ow-cli) tool.
- Exposes an app's public release notes through a [public endpoint](developers-console/all-applications/release-management#release-notes-endpoint).

When you first open the console, you will be greeted by a log-in page.

Once you log-in, using your google account, you will be moved to the console's home-page.
![The All Applications Tab](/assets/tools/developers-console/all-applications/index.jpg)

From here, you will be able to freely navigate the console.

## The Header Toolbar

The header toolbar allows you to do several things:
- Using the "burget menu" in the left, you can collapse or expand the sidebar.
- By clicking on the `Overwolf {dev}` icon, you will be taken back to the console's [homepage](developers-console/all-applications).
- By clicking on the circular arrow, you can refresh the console's data in real-time, without refreshing the page.
- By clicking on your user's icon, you can choose to log out from the console.

## The Footer Toolbar

## The Paging Footer
