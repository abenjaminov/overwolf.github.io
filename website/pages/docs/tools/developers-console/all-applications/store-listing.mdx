![The Store Listing Tab](/assets/tools/developers-console/all-applications/store-listing/index.jpg)
This section of the console allows you to manage everything involving your app's store listing.

This page utilizes the [Footer Toolbar](../#the-footer-toolbar) in order to manage changes made to any fields.

## App details

![App Details](/assets/tools/developers-console/all-applications/store-listing/app-details.jpg)

Under App details, you can view and edit several parts of your apps' store listing:
- App Name - The name that will be displayed for your app in the store. **This can be different from the app's manifest [`name`](/api/manifest#meta-name)!**
- Author - The name that will be displayed for the app's author in the store. Uses [`author_display`](/api/manifest#meta-author-display), defaulting to [`author`](/api/manifest#meta-author) if it does not exist.
- App URL - Your app's unique store page URL.
- Monetization - A quick summary of the app's currently supported and enabled monetization (free? has ads? has subscription?).
- Short description - A **plain-text** short description for your app, displayed on your app's preview in the store.
- Full description - A full description for your app, displayed on your app's store page. Supports [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/).
  - Similarly to [Release Notes](release-management#edit-release-notes), there is a `Preview` button to see how the final description looks.
  Make sure to check that your description looks exactly like you want it to before submitting it.


## Graphic assets

![Graphic Assets](/assets/tools/developers-console/all-applications/store-listing/graphic-assets.jpg)

Under Graphic assets, you can change your app's store listing assets:
- App icon - The icon used for the app in the store.
- Tile image - The image used for your app's store tile.
- Screenshots - Between 1 and 5 screenshots representing your app.

:::note Image Sizes
Keep in mind that all app assets have their own strict size and format requirements. For further reading, refer to the
`?` icons near each image section in the console, and to [Prepare your store assets](/start/submit-your-app#prepare-your-store-assets).
