## Why is this important 

Replying to reviews engages your users and makes them feel valued, further building loyalty.
- Properly replying to positive reviews will help the user feel like someone cares about their feedback.
- Properly replying to negative reviews can help change the user's mind, as well as show potential users that you value criticism.

## App Score

![App Score Overview](/assets/tools/developers-console/all-applications/user-feedback/reviews/app-score.jpg)
At the top of the page, you can see a summary of your app's ratings, including:
- `Overwolf Appstore rating` - Your app's current appstore rating. This is a simple average of all review scores for the app.
- `Total ratings` - The total amount of reviews ever left on your app.

## Reviews List

It is possible to filter the app reviews being shown by several things:
- `Ratings` - "Only show reviews that gave x stars" (Can choose multiple).
- `Add filter` -> `Date` - "Only show reviews written after time x and/or before time y".
![List Of App Reviews](/assets/tools/developers-console/all-applications/user-feedback/reviews/reviews-listing.jpg)

App reviews are also split into pages, using [The Paging Footer](../../#the-footer-toolbar).

### App Reviews

Here, you can see the individual reviews left by users.

Reviews will always contain the following:
- The reviewer's username.
- The date that the review was made on.
- The score given by the review (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars).
- Information of the user's client at the time of the review (**only for use in providing context for the review**), including:
    - `App version`.
    - `Overwolf version`.
    - `GEP version`.
    - `Operating system` (When expanded).
    - `Main screen size` && `Main screen DPI` (When expanded).
    - (If the user has a secondary screen) - `Seconday screen size` && `Secondary screen DPI` (When expanded).
- An overview of your team's **public** reply to the review (if there is any), including:
    - Responder email.
    - Date of the original reply.
    - The reply's contents (editable).

When editing your team's reply to a review, you can use the `Discard` and `Update reply` buttons, which correspond to the `Discard changes` and `Save` buttons of [The Footer Toolbar](../../#the-footer-toolbar).

Reviews will also often (but not always) contain text. when they do, it will also be shown inside the review's overview.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="review-closed" label="Review">

An example app review. The "Client information" section at the bottom is closed, and so we only see some of the details.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="review-opened" label="Expanded Review">

An example app review. The "Client information" section at the bottom is open, and so we see all client details.
![Expanded App Review](/assets/tools/developers-console/all-applications/user-feedback/reviews/review-expanded.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="review-no-response" label="Review Without Response" default>

An example app review. As there is no response to the review, we are prompted with a text field for the response.
![App Review Without Response](/assets/tools/developers-console/all-applications/user-feedback/reviews/review-no-response.jpg)

Once we start typing, the `Discard` and `Public reply` buttons will appear, allowing us to discard or publish this response.
![App Review With Response Draft](/assets/tools/developers-console/all-applications/user-feedback/reviews/review-response-draft.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="review-deleted" label="Deleted Review">

Sometimes, a review will be deleted, due to external reasons. In that case, you will be able to see the review's delete date
under `Deleted at`, and while you will be able to see the original review, you will not be able to interact with it, and it will
not affect your app's score.

## Responding To Reviews

Responding to reviews can be somewhat emotional. However, what feels right to say might not always actually be what's right.

Because of that, we have compiled a list of best practices for responding to reviews.

- When responding, stay concise and clear when addressing any feedback.
- Strive for a friendly tone that’s consistent with the voice of your brand, keeping the right level of professionalism.
- Remain positive and respectful, even if it seems the user is attacking. You can start with something similar to
"Thanks, your feedback helps us improve our app". Always clearly acknowledge the reviewer's feedback,
and let them know if you’re working on taking care of the issue.
Something in the lines of, "This is a known issue, and we are doing our best to fix it" can go a long way.
- Use proper grammar and spelling. We recommend using tools like [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/). 
- Personalizing your responses rather than using generic responses for similar reviews (e.g. "Hey Alex, thanks for your feedback.").
- When you release an app update that fixes issues mentioned in older reviews, consider replying to relevant reviews to tell these users about the fix.
    - Also make sure to update any reviews where you mentioned that you will be fixing this issue.

:::tip Keep in mind

- You can only send one reply per review. This means that after adding your response, you can edit it - but not add another reply.
- Users can't respond to your reply, nor can they create a thread/discussion, etc. They can, however, edit their own review.
- Users do not receive any notification when you reply to their review. 

In future versions, we might add more features, such as notifying users when someone replies to their review. Feel free to request those in our [faq](/support/faq).
