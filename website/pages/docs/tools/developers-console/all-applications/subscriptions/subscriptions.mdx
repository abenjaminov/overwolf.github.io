This section of the console allows you to manage your app's active subscriptions and subscription plans.
![The Subscriptions Tab](/assets/tools/developers-console/all-applications/subscriptions/index.jpg)

If you donâ€™t yet have a subscription plan enabled, follow [our guide first](/start/monetize-with-subs/subscriptions-overview).

Inside this tab, you will find:
- Subscription [Statistics](subscriptions/statistics).
- [Subscription Plans](subscriptions/subscription-plans) listing.
- [Subscribers](subscriptions/subscribers) listing.

:::note Plan Activity
Your app can have several different subscription plans, and each user can have several different active subscriptions.

However, only one subscription plan can be "Activated" at any point. This plan, marked as "Active" in its status, will be the plan
that any user attempting to purchase a subscription to the app will be pointed to.

**A user can have an active subscription to an inactive plan, and even renew it automatically through Xsolla!**
**As such, changing the active subscription plan will not affect existing subscribers!**
